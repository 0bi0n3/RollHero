Developed with Unreal Engine 5. Following Stephen Ulibarri's tutorial on Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints but converted to an UE5 project.

### Audio Programming Test Environment
The project will not vary much from the tutorial gameplay and asset wise. However, the template project will be used for audio implementation, middleware integration and other audio programming tests and practices.
